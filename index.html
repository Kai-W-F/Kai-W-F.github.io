    <div id="overview">
        AI has become an increasingly popular solution to automate all sorts of tasks around the world, but are we sure that we can trust these AIs to be objective and free from the biases a human could have? While it is common to view AI as above having human bias, they are not as fool-proof as it may seem. However, before I explain that, I need to define a few terms and what an AI is. To begin, there are two types of AI: 1) an AI where the developer writes out a strict set of rules and the program follows that, and 2) a machine learning AI that is given mass amounts of data to review, which they then create their own set of “rules” in the form of a mathematical probability model. In this paper I will strictly be talking about the latter, machine learning AI, due to it being by far the much more common as well as the much less certain outcomes it brings. Now that I have laid out what an AI is, it is important to understand what that entails: 1) the AI will always be “objective” in the sense that it will always give the “correct” output given the training data and model design; it does not think, 2) what the model thinks is right is not necessarily what is actually right, and 3) due to the nature of machine learning, the creators or developers of AI do not have much insight into what the AI is looking for in order to classify or predict something. The developers only know the input, output, training data, and the overall model design. Because of this, an AI can contain bias without the developers’ knowing or directly adding it, which can be very problematic given that AI is making its way into fields with higher stakes such as healthcare or governmental services.
