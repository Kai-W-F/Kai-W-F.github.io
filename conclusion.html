                <p>
                    It is clear through this paper that AI is lacking in fairness or mitigation for bias. However, it is important to take into account the other side because, while AI can still contain bias, it is often still better than humans in some cases at being objective. It may also depend on the context in which the AI is being used. In something such as predicting the weather or self-driving cars, it probably will not matter. It is when that bias is further embedding systematic bias between people that it becomes a problem. So when I conclude that AI cannot yet be trusted to be free of human biases, I do not mean it in the sense that we should not continue to use AI in these areas. I simply mean that we should reframe our perspective of AI to not be as trusting of their ability to not have prejudice because they often learn that prejudice or bias from us still. When AI is being used in more areas where the stakes are much higher such as healthcare, biometrics, or crime prevention, it could be devastating if our systematic biases become automated and embedded into our lives. Which is why it is important that we be skeptical of AI's fairness and that we push for regulations on these AI that will be influencing our lives so much.
